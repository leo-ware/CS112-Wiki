# CS112-Wiki
### Based on [idyll-multipage-example](https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll-multipage-example)

Our incredible CS112 wiki.

### Project overview

- `posts` - all of the available posts, each directory within contains a full idyll post
- `components` - shared components, can be used by any post. Each post also has its own components folder where you can put components that don't need to be shared.
- `template` - the post template to use when you run `idyll create`. Update this template with site specific styles, configuration, etc.
- `index.idyll` - the root/index page for the blog. Note this is not autogenerated.
- `docs` - the folder where the output is built. Deploy to any static hosting service (we name it `docs` so its easy to host on github pages).

## Installation

- Make sure you have `idyll` installed (`npm i -g idyll`).
- Clone this repo and run `npm install`.

## Creating a post

Navigate to the posts directory and run `idyll create --template ../template/`

## Developing a post locally

Navigate to the post's directory and run `idyll`.

## Building a post for production

Navigate to the post's directory and run `idyll build`. The output will appear in the top-level `docs` folder.

## Deploying

Make sure all of your posts have been built, then deploy the docs folder via any static hosting service.

## Dependencies

You can install custom dependencies on a per-post basis by running `yarn install` in the post directory.
