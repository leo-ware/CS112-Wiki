These tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Broadly speaking, supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of this nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and public policy. With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and structure from such data.</p><ul><li>principle components of data</li><li>dimensions</li></ul><h1 id="study-guide">Study Guide</h1><ol><li>A Bosnian NGO is providing safety gear and training to homeless street kids who collect and sell recyclable trash by the kilo to neighborhood recycling centers.
